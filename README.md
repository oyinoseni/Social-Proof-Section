### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first time using CSS Grid, though I have not completely grabbed the concept and I hope to learn more. I also learnt CSS positioning to implement the design for the ratings section and movement of the background image. 


### Continued development

I need to improve on CSS Grid and Positioning.
